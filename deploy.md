# Deployment Instructions

## Vercel Deployment

The project is now configured for Vercel deployment with the following files:

- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
- `.vercelignore` - Files to ignore during deployment
- `package.json` - Updated with homepage field

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Configuration Details

- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `build`
- **Framework:** `create-react-app`
- **Homepage:** Set to `.` for relative paths

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Check that all files are committed and pushed
2. Verify the build works locally with `npm run build`
3. Check Vercel logs for specific error messages
4. Ensure the `public/index.html` file exists
